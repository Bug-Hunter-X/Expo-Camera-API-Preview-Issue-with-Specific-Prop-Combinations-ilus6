This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with specific props in a React Native project.  The issue manifests as an unexpected behavior where the camera preview either fails to load, freezes, or displays a blank screen. This is particularly noticeable when using certain combinations of props like `ratio`, `type`, `flashMode`, and `zoom`.  The inconsistent behavior across different devices and Expo SDK versions points to a potential compatibility issue or unexpected interaction within the API itself.
