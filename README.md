# Expo Camera API Preview Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API with certain prop combinations. The camera preview may fail to load, freeze, or display a blank screen. This issue appears to be inconsistent across different devices and Expo SDK versions.

## Bug Description

The bug manifests as an unpredictable failure of the camera preview.  The preview might not load at all, freeze mid-operation, or remain blank. This behavior seems to correlate with specific combinations of `ratio`, `type`, `flashMode`, and `zoom` props.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Observe the camera preview.  Experiment with different prop combinations to reproduce the issue.

## Solution

The provided solution explores potential workarounds and best practices to mitigate the issue. It might involve careful selection of props, adjusting the prop combinations, error handling or even investigating alternative approaches for camera implementation depending on the specific needs of the project.
