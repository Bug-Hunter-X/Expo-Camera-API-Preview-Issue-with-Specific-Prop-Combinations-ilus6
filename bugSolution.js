In the `bugSolution.js` file, we implement several strategies to address the camera preview issues:

1. **Prop Combination Adjustments:** We carefully curate the prop combinations to identify specific combinations that cause the issues and avoid them, using more compatible settings for better stability. 
2. **Error Handling:** We incorporate error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle potential failures during camera initialization or preview rendering. This includes catching exceptions and displaying informative error messages to the user.
3. **Asynchronous Operations:** We ensure asynchronous operations related to camera access and preview updates are correctly managed using promises or async/await to avoid race conditions or unexpected behaviors. 
4. **Fallback Mechanism:** If certain functionalities or prop combinations lead to consistent errors, we provide a fallback mechanism to render a placeholder or alternative UI element. This helps improve the user experience and prevents a complete app crash. 
5. **Permissions Check:** Explicitly ensure camera permissions are granted before attempting to access the camera.  Handle permission denials appropriately.

By systematically addressing these aspects and carefully managing resource usage, the likelihood of the camera preview issues is significantly reduced.
